# 🔧 Vercel Deployment Fix

**Issue**: `If 'rewrites', 'redirects', 'headers', 'cleanUrls' or 'trailingSlash' are used, then 'routes' cannot be present.`

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🚨 Problem

Vercel's modern configuration doesn't allow `routes` property when using other routing properties like `headers`, `redirects`, etc.

**Old Configuration (Broken)**:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [...],
  "routes": [...],     // ❌ This conflicts
  "headers": [...],    // ❌ With this
  "redirects": [...],  // ❌ And this
  "trailingSlash": false
}
```

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

**New Configuration (`frontend/vercel.json`)**:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "labtanam-frontend",
  "cleanUrls": true,
  "trailingSlash": false,
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Frame-Options", 
          "value": "DENY"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-XSS-Protection",
          "value": "1; mode=block"
        },
        {
          "key": "Referrer-Policy",
          "value": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "source": "/js/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "source": "/assets/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/home",
      "destination": "/",
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```
